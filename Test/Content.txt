exampe.m - This example uses the network file Net2.inp and the
            msx file net2-cl2.msx % (distributed with the MSX toolkit as
            example 2) % to plot the CL2 data of node 1, linke 1, node 17
            and link 17.

The Toolkit example includes EPANET and MSX functionality and
is based on example 2 of the MSX package:
Net2.inp - Network
            input file used for EPANET and MSX toolkit test and example.
net2-cl2.msx - MSX input file used for MSX toolkit test and
                example.

Test functions for toolkit functions
ENwraptest.m    - Tests all the existing Matlab wrappers for the EPANET toolkit functions.
